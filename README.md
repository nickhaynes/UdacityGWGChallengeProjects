# Grow with Google/Udacity Challenge Course

Projects and quizzes undertaken as part of the challenge course in the Udacity/Grow With Google Front-End Web Development Scholarship Program

##Description

In January 2018, I was among 15,000 individuals selected for Round 1 of the _Grow with Google_ Front-End Web Developer Scholarship Track offered by Udacity.  In Round 1, scholarship participants learn the basics of web development over 3 months, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

On April 17th, the top 1,500 individuals who successfully completed the challenge course by April 11th, will be awarded a full scholarship for Udacity's Front-End Web Development nanodegree, a six-month course designed to fully equip individuals for work in front-end develpment.
